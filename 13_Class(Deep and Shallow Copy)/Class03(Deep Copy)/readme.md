# Deep Copy in Python

## What is Deep Copy in Python?
Deep copy is a concept in Python that refers to copying an object and all its nested objects, ensuring that the copy is completely independent from the original. This means that changes made to the copied object will not affect the original object, and vice versa.

Python provides a way to perform deep copying through the `copy` module. The `deepcopy()` function from this module creates a new object with the same contents as the original, but with its own memory addresses for all nested objects.

## Why Use Deep Copy in Python?
Deep copy is useful when you need to create a copy of an object with complex internal structures, such as nested lists, dictionaries, or custom objects, and you want to avoid unintended modifications between the original and the copied objects.

Here are some common scenarios where deep copy is beneficial:

- **Cloning complex objects**: When you want to create a new instance of an object with the same data without altering the original instance.
- **Preserving original data**: When you need to work on a copy of the data while keeping the original intact for future reference or undoing changes.
- **Creating backup copies**: In cases where you need a backup of an object before making significant modifications.

## Advantages of Deep Copy in Python
The key advantage of deep copy is its isolation between the original and copied objects. This provides the following benefits:

1. **No Side Effects**: Changes made to the deep copy do not affect the original object, preventing unintended side effects in shared data structures.
2. **Safer Modifications**: You can safely modify a deep copy without risking changes to the original object, which is useful in complex applications.
3. **Better Data Integrity**: Deep copy helps maintain data integrity by ensuring that original data remains unchanged, even when its copy is manipulated.

## Example Usage
Here's an example demonstrating the use of deep copy in Python:

```python
import copy

original = [['Hashim', 'Tahir', 24], [1, 2, 3], ['x', True, 97.5]]

# Create a deep copy of the original list
deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(original)

# Modify the deep copy
deep_copy[0][0] = 'Ali'

print("Original:", original)  # Output: [['Hashim', 'Tahir', 24], [1, 2, 3], ['x', True, '97.5']]
print("Deep Copy:", deep_copy)  # Output: [['Ali', 'Tahir', 24], [1, 2, 3], ['x', True, '97.5']]
