## Introduction
When working with data structures in many programming languages, copying can occur when you assign one variable to another. This can result in unexpected behavior, especially in large-scale applications or systems with stringent performance requirements.

This project demonstrates methods and best practices to avoid these issues by preventing data copying with assignment operators.

## Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to set a variable equal to a value, another variable, or a structure. The most common is the equal sign `=`. When using assignment operators, it's important to understand if the data is being copied or if a reference to the original data is being created.

## Avoiding Copies
To avoid copying data unintentionally, follow these guidelines:

1. **Use References Instead of Copies**: When assigning values, ensure you're creating a reference rather than a new copy. This approach minimizes memory usage and avoids accidental duplication.

2. **Immutable Data Structures**: In some languages, immutable data structures prevent data copying, as they create new objects instead of modifying existing ones.

3. **Use Functional Programming Techniques**: Functional programming often relies on references and immutable data, reducing the risk of copying when assigning values.

## Example Use Cases
- **Linked Lists and Trees**: When manipulating linked lists or tree structures, avoid copying entire sub-trees. Use references to update specific nodes.
- **Large Arrays and Collections**: When working with large data sets, ensure you're referencing data rather than creating new instances.
- **Concurrent Programming**: In multi-threaded environments, use references to shared resources rather than copying data to avoid race conditions.

## Best Practices
- **Use Copy-On-Write (COW)**: Some languages support COW, where copying occurs only if data is modified. This approach reduces unnecessary duplication.
- **Utilize Smart Pointers**: In languages like C++, smart pointers help manage memory without copying data unnecessarily.
- **Leverage Framework Features**: Use built-in features of frameworks or libraries to manage data references and avoid copying.
